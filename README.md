### Trees 
- Used a Lindenmayer system to simulate natural branching of trees at various degrees of complexity
- Tree's branches become progressively thinner with each branching

### Terrain
- Procedurally generated using Perlin noise
- Used a modified dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for depressions in ground for rivers

### Water 
- Base water shader is based on https://29a.ch/slides/2012/webglwater/#slide-53 and https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/jsm/objects/Water.js 
- Implements a water shader with waves created from normal maps.
- The normal map is sampled using time-dependent noise algorithm from 29a.ch to create moving waves
- The geometry of the water is modified in the y dimension using a scrolling height map
- The other aspects of the shader like reflections & refraction are taken from the three.js water shader
